                <td id="td2"><p>In season 2, the team shows the fisherman a tracking chip that they will put in Player 456’s tooth to know exactly where the island is when Player 456 returns to the squid games to try to end the games. But it is revealed once Player 456 returns to the games again that his tracking chip in his tooth has disappeared</p></td>
                <td id="td2"><p>It is strange that the guards discovered the chip because it is shown in both season of squid game that players have sneaked items into the games, knifes, lighters, pills</p></td>

                <td id="td2"><p>In season 2, after coming to the realization that the tooth chip tracker was discovered and destroyed after not being able to see the tracker on their devices. The team has to search every island one by one to find the island</p></td>
                <td id="td2"><p>One of episodes that focuses on the team searching for the island. They are shown sleeping in the boat. Yet, the fisherman is seen working on one of the drones that has been used for searching for the island. Once, somebody that is keeping the perimeter notices that the fisherman is awake. He is shocked that the fisherman is still awake and begins to ask him what he is doing to the drone. The fisherman tries to cover up what he is doing and telling the man that he is seeing things, due to it being late in the night. The man won’t budge about what fisherman is doing, so the fisherman decides to stab him and throw him over the boat into the ocean to die</p></td>
                <td id="td2"><p>The loud splash wakes up one of the members of the search team and runs to the noise. He notices the fisherman is there and ask him what that noise was. The fisherman dismisses him and tells him to go back to bed</p></td>

                <th id="th1">Reason Three</th>
                <td id="td2"><p>Throughout the seasons, it has been known that the guards in the squid games shoot players that have been eliminated not directly at their organs to kill them, such as their brain or heart. The reason for this is because there is an organization happening on the side where guards preserve the eliminated players organs and give them to somebody on a boat and receive money for their actions, yet it is never revealed who they handed it off to, but the fisherman is the only character that is known for having a boat</p></td>

            <th id="th1">Conclusion</th>
            <td id="td2"><p>The fisherman is making things a hundred times harder for Gi-hun, Jun-ho, and the team. He’s out here sabotaging their mission, covering for the games, and even killing people to keep his secrets safe. If this theory is right, he’s basically a hidden villain, and his betrayal is a big deal. He adds a whole new level of drama and tension to the story—and honestly, now you’ve gotta wonder how many other people are working with the games too</p></td>
