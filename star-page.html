The plan consists in taking the guards guns once they grab the players for the fourth game, shoot them, and head to the Frontman’s office to kill him, which would end the games</p></td>
                <td id="td2"><p>The plan goes smoothly, but Player 388 is seen having a nervous attack by not shooting or shooting in areas where the guards aren’t even in range while hiding behind a wall. It could be due to the ptsd from his time in the military</p></td>

Player 120 agrees and Player 388 is off to get the ammo. While he is retrieving the ammo he begins to have a nervous attack again and freezes with all the ammo</p></td>

Player 388 never answers and Player 120 goes to see what has happened because their team is very low on ammo now and can no longer reach the Frontman’s office. She finds Player 388 frozen with all the ammo in his hands. She tries to talk to him, but he can only say sorry to her. Player 120 decided to take the ammo from his hands and go back to the team with the ammo, but is stoped by all the guards</p></td>

Yet, the only player that wasn’t introduced was Player 388. He is introduced after the first game when he goes directly to Player 456 to introduce himself to him.

Every player was called from Player 456 to Player 001. Once it was Player 388’s turn to vote x or o another man with the number 388 on his shirt appears and is seen going up to the buzzer</p></td>

            <th id="th1">Conclusion</th>
            <td id="td2"><p>Dae-ho’s unusual introduction, suspicious behavior during critical moments, and the presence of a second Player 388 strongly suggest he is more than just a regular contestant. His role as a possible VIP or insider creates a fascinating twist, adding layers of betrayal and control to the Squid Games' narrative. This theory underscores the games' ruthlessness, where even trusted allies may turn out to be enemies working against the players’ survival. </p></td>
