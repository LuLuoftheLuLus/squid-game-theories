                <td id="td2"><p>Player 246, Min Jae-seok, is a struggling painter working at a local fair to support his young daughter, who is battling cancer. As a single father overwhelmed by the cost of her life-saving treatment, he joins the Squid Game as a desperate last resort. His love for his daughter drives his every decision, and his creativity and attention to detail, honed through his art, become unexpected strengths in his fight for survival</p></td>

                <td id="td2"><p>Gyu-young (Guard 011) works as a mascot at the same fair as Player 246, living out of her car and struggling to make ends meet. She forms a quiet bond with a little girl in a strawberry hat, giving her a lollipop every day they see each other. One day, after quitting her job and walking out of the fair, Gyu-young notices an ambulance rushing back toward where she had just passed. She sees the little girl unconscious, with her distressed father following as they load her into the ambulance. After it speeds away, Gyu-young finds the girl’s strawberry hat on the ground and decides to bring it to the hospital. Later, she is approached by a mysterious man who hands her a card inviting her to the Squid Games—not as a player but as Guard 011, responsible for executing players announced as eliminated</p></td>

                <td id="td2"><p>In the squid games, instead of guards shooting the players to death once they’ve been announced as eliminated, they shoot them not at their organs to preserve their organs for a side business that is happening secretly. But Guard 011 doesn’t participate in this</p></td>
                <td id="td2"><p>In the first squid games, right light, green light, the guards wait for the announcer to call which player will be eliminated and the guards shoot them. During the game, they announced to Guard 011 that Player 246 is eliminated. Guard 011 doesn’t shoot him because she knows that his daughter is sick and needs him alive</p></td>

                <td id="td2"><p>when a bunch of the players: Player 456, 120, 388, and 390 decide to rebel and unfortunately fail, due to not having enough ammo to kill all the guards to reach the Frontman’s office the guards begin to kill the players that rebelled one of them being Player 246. The guard begin goes up to Player 246 and he says to the guard to not kill him because he has a sick daughter at home, but gets shot and falls to the ground. Yet, Player 246 was never announced dead (which always happens in the games), never shown taking his last breath, and never put into a coffin (which guards do once a player is dead)</p></td>

            <td id="td2"><p>fans speculate that Guard 011 was the one that shot him because she has proven to have a soft spot for him, due to his daughter being sick, and has saved him once already, which is why she would shoot him not at his brain and more towards his lower body to keep him alive enough to recover, but look dead</p></td>
